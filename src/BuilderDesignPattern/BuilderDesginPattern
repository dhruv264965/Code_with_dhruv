The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. Instead
of using a constructor with many parameters, the builder pattern provides a more readable and flexible way to
create objects.

When to Use the Builder Pattern?
1->jab class mai many attribute ho so making constractor become messy and optional parameter bhi ho.
2->When we want to create immutable object


Imagine a User class with multiple attributes:

java
Copy
Edit
class User {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String email;
    private String address;

    // Constructor with many parameters (hard to read & maintain)
    public User(String name, int age, String email, String address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.email = email;
        this.address = address;
    }
}
The problem? If you need to add more optional fields, you'll end up with multiple constructors (telescoping problem).
