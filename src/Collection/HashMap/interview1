Q->if hashcode generated unique or constant value . what affect in performacnce,
Anser->1. Poorly Implemented hashCode()
       A poor hashCode() implementation typically occurs when:

       It always returns the same value (e.g., hashCode() returns a constant).
       It does not distribute objects uniformly across buckets.
       Performance Impact:
       Excessive Collisions: When all objects are hashed to the same bucket, the HashMap or HashSet degenerates into a linked list (or balanced tree in Java 8+ for large buckets), and the time complexity for operations such as get(), put(), and remove() becomes O(n) instead of O(1).

       Reduced Scalability: As the number of elements grows, performance degrades dramatically since all operations must traverse the bucket's list or tree.
       @Override
       public int hashCode() {
           return 1; // Poor implementation, every object hashes to the same bucket
       }
2. hashCode() Inconsistent with equals()
This occurs when equals() considers two objects as equal, but their hashCode() values differ.

Performance Impact:
Broken Contract: The HashMap or HashSet relies on the invariant that if two objects are equal (equals() returns true), they must have the same hashCode(). If this is violated:

The data structure may place these objects in different buckets.
Lookup (get()) and removal (remove()) may fail because the hashCode() points to a different bucket than the one where the object was stored.
Unpredictable Behavior: Even if the data structure appears to work in some cases, the results are unreliable and can lead to debugging nightmares.
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    // Equality based on id
    return obj instanceof Employee && this.id == ((Employee) obj).id;
}

@Override
public int hashCode() {
    // Incorrect: hashCode doesn't depend on id
    return Objects.hash(name); // Uses name instead
}
In this case, two Employee objects with the same id but different name will be stored in separate buckets, breaking retrieval.
3. Good hashCode() Implementation
A well-implemented hashCode():

Distributes objects uniformly across buckets to minimize collisions.
Is consistent with equals().
Performance Benefits:
Optimal Bucket Utilization: With fewer collisions, operations such as get(), put(), and remove() maintain an average time complexity of O(1).

Better Scalability: Performance remains stable even as the number of elements grows, ensuring predictable behavior.

Example:@Override
        public int hashCode() {
            return Objects.hash(id, name); // Combines meaningful fields
        }
This ensures a good distribution of hash values based on both id and name.

Best Practices for hashCode():
Use the Same Fields as equals(): Ensure hashCode() includes all fields used in equals().

Leverage Objects.hash(): This simplifies the computation of hash codes while maintaining consistency.

Avoid Constant or Simple Hash Codes: E.g., avoid returning a constant or directly returning the id if it leads to a poor distribution.

Immutability: Ensure fields used in equals() and hashCode() are immutable (or do not change after the object is added to a hash-based collection).
