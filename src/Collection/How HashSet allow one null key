✅ How HashSet stores null internally
🔧 Background:
HashSet uses a HashMap<E, Object> internally.
Each element you add to the HashSet is actually added as a key in the HashMap.

✅ How does HashMap handle null keys?
HashMap allows only one null key.
When you insert a null key, it is placed in a special bucket (index 0).

Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
set.add(null);
set.add(null);  // Ignored, duplicate
System.out.println(set); // Output: [null]

Even though HashSet uses hashCode() and equals(), it can store null because the backing HashMap allows a single
 null key, which is handled as a special case (bucket 0), bypassing the usual hashing mechanism.”
