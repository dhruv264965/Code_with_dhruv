Relaxed binding in Spring Boot allows for flexibility when mapping environment properties to your application's configuration
properties.
Here's how it works:
Case insensitivity:
Spring Boot ignores the case of property names when matching them to your configuration properties. For example, server.port and
SERVER_PORT are considered the same.
Hyphen and underscore interchangeability:
You can use hyphens or underscores interchangeably in your property names. For example, spring.datasource.url and spring_datasource_url
 are considered the same.
Nested properties:
You can use dot notation to represent nested properties in your configuration. For example, spring.datasource.username can be mapped
to a property named username within a datasource object in your configuration class.
@ConfigurationProperties("my-app")
public class MyAppConfig {
    private String myProperty;

    // Getter and setter for myProperty
}
You can now set this property in your application.properties file using any of the following formats:
my-app.my-property=value
MY_APP_MY_PROPERTY=value
my_app.myProperty=value
MY_APP_MYPROPERTY=value
Benefits:
Easier to work with environment variables:
Environment variables often use uppercase and underscores, so relaxed binding allows you to map them to your configuration properties without any extra effort.
More flexibility in naming conventions:
You can choose the naming convention that best suits your project without worrying about exact matches.
