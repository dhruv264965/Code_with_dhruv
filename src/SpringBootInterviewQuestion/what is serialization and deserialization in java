Serialization in Java is the process of converting an object into a byte stream. This byte stream can
be stored in a file, database, or transmitted over a network. The primary purpose of serialization is
to save the state of an object so that it can be recreated later.
Deserialization, on the other hand, is the reverse process of converting a byte stream back into a Java
object. This allows the object to be restored to its original state, enabling its use in the application.

Key Points:
Purpose:
Serialization enables the persistence of an object's state, while deserialization reconstructs the
object from its serialized form.
Use Cases:
Serialization is used for saving objects to files, sending objects over networks, and storing objects
in databases.
Serialization Interface:
To serialize an object, the class must implement the java.io.Serializable interface.
serialVersionUID:
It's good practice to define a serialVersionUID in classes that implement Serializable. This ensures
compatibility when deserializing objects if the class structure changes.
Transient Fields:
Fields marked as transient are not serialized, so they are not saved or restored during deserialization.
Constructors:
The constructor of the object is not called during deserialization.
In summary, serialization and deserialization enable the transportation and storage of Java objects while
 preserving their state and structure.
