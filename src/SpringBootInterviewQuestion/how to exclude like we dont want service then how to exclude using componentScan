If you want Spring to exclude specific components, like @Service-annotated classes, from
being picked up by @ComponentScan, you can do that using excludeFilters in the @ComponentScan annotation.
Example->@SpringBootApplication
         @ComponentScan(
             basePackages = "com.example",
             excludeFilters = @ComponentScan.Filter(
                 type = FilterType.ANNOTATION,
                 classes = Service.class
             )
         )
         public class MyApp { }
