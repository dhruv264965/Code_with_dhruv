‚úÖ Ways to Reduce API Response Time
1Ô∏è‚É£ Parallel Processing with CompletableFuture
Instead of calling multiple services sequentially, I use CompletableFuture.supplyAsync() to call APIs in parallel and
merge the results.

This significantly reduces latency for aggregator services.

üó£Ô∏è "In one project, I fetched pricing, reviews, and stock data from 3 microservices using CompletableFuture.allOf(),
 which reduced response time from ~3s to ~1s."

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use WebClient instead of RestTemplate
WebClient is non-blocking and asynchronous, allowing better resource utilization (especially with many I/O-bound calls).

Works great with CompletableFuture, Mono.zip, or reactive streams.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Enable Response Caching
Use Spring Cache or a distributed cache (e.g., Redis) to cache frequently accessed responses.

Helps avoid repeated calls to downstream services or databases.

üó£Ô∏è "We cached frequently requested product data in Redis with a 5-minute TTL to reduce load and latency."

4Ô∏è‚É£ Use Load Balancing and Service Discovery
Use Spring Cloud LoadBalancer or Ribbon with Eureka to distribute requests across multiple service instances.

Prevents bottlenecks and improves availability.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Optimize DB Queries
Use indexes, projections, pagination, and batch queries.

Avoid N+1 queries by using JOINs or @EntityGraph.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Connection Pooling (DB & HTTP)
Use HikariCP (default in Spring Boot) for database pooling.

Configure connection pools for WebClient or Apache HTTP Client.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Reduce Payload Size
Use DTOs to return only required fields.

Compress responses using GZIP.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Asynchronous Controllers (@Async)
Use @Async in service layer with @EnableAsync to offload long-running tasks.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Use CDN and Edge Caching (if external APIs are used)
If you're serving static or public data, cache it at the edge using a CDN.

üß† How to Frame Your Answer in Interview:
"To reduce API response time, I use a combination of techniques depending on the use case.
For internal microservices, I parallelize API calls using CompletableFuture + WebClient.
We also cache frequent responses in Redis, optimize DB queries, and configure proper connection pools.
This helped us reduce latency significantly in our aggregator service."
