The spring-boot-starter-parent is a special starter in Spring Boot projects. It provides a parent Maven POM
(Project Object Model) that sets up the foundational configurations for your project. By including it in your
pom.xml, you inherit a set of sensible defaults, dependency management, and other settings, saving time and effort.

Dependency versions: Handles the versions for Spring Boot, Hibernate, Jackson, Tomcat, and more.
Maven defaults: Sensible defaults for building, testing, and packaging the application.
Plugin management: Configurations for Maven plugins.
Property configurations: Common properties like java.version, encoding, etc.
