âœ… What is SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)?
A protocol for accessing web services.
Uses XML format strictly.
Operates over HTTP, SMTP, etc.
Strict standards and built-in error handling (WS-Security, WS-ReliableMessaging, etc.)

âœ… What is REST (Representational State Transfer)?
An architecture style, not a protocol.
Communicates via HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Supports multiple data formats (JSON, XML, YAML), but mostly uses JSON.
Stateless, lightweight, faster

| Feature         | SOAP                           | REST                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Type**        | Protocol                       | Architectural Style                |
| **Data format** | XML only                       | JSON (preferred), XML, others      |
| **Speed**       | Slower due to XML              | Faster, lightweight                |
| **Transport**   | HTTP, SMTP, TCP                | HTTP only                          |
| **Security**    | WS-Security                    | HTTPS + custom auth                |
| **State**       | Can be stateful                | Stateless                          |
| **Complexity**  | More complex (WSDL, envelopes) | Simple and easy to integrate       |
| **Best for**    | Enterprise-level transactions  | Mobile, public APIs, microservices |


ðŸŽ¯ When to Use Which?
âœ… Use SOAP when:
You need enterprise-grade security (banking, financial).
You need ACID-compliant transactions (atomicity).
The client expects strict contract (WSDL).

âœ… Use REST when:
You're building scalable, fast web or mobile apps.
You want flexible data formats (mostly JSON).
You're developing microservices or public APIs.

ðŸ§  How to Explain in Interview
"SOAP is a protocol with strict rules and XML-based messaging, suitable for enterprise applications where high security
 and standardized communication are crucial. REST is an architectural style that's simpler and faster, ideal for
 lightweight, stateless APIs â€” especially in microservices and mobile apps.

For example, if I'm building a weather app for mobile, I'd prefer REST due to its lightweight nature and JSON support.
 But if I'm integrating with a payment gateway that requires security standards, I might go for SOAP."
