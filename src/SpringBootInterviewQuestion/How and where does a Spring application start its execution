1. Where does Spring Boot application start?

A Spring Boot application always starts from the main method of the class annotated with:
@SpringBootApplication (or @SpringBootConfiguration + @EnableAutoConfiguration + @ComponentScan)

Example:

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }
}

2. How does it start execution?
Step 1: JVM Execution
Like any Java program, execution starts from the main method.
Here, SpringApplication.run() is the entry point into the Spring world.

Step 2: SpringApplication.run()
Bootstraps the application:
Creates an ApplicationContext (IoC container).
Starts auto-configuration (enabled by @EnableAutoConfiguration).
Performs component scanning (enabled by @ComponentScan).
Registers all Spring Beans.
Starts the embedded server (Tomcat/Jetty/Undertow) if it‚Äôs a web app.

Step 3: ApplicationContext Initialization

Beans are created and dependencies are injected.
@PostConstruct methods and lifecycle callbacks are executed.

Step 4: Run Listeners & CommandLineRunner

Spring triggers ApplicationRunner and CommandLineRunner beans after startup.
Good place for initialization logic.

Step 5: Application Ready

If it‚Äôs a web app:
Embedded Tomcat server starts.
Application listens on configured port (e.g., 8080).
If it‚Äôs a console app:
Runs till main thread ends or task is completed.

3. Summary Answer for Interview
üëâ ‚ÄúA Spring Boot application starts execution from the main method like any normal Java application. The call to
 SpringApplication.run() bootstraps Spring. It creates the ApplicationContext, performs component scanning, applies
  auto-configuration, and starts the embedded server (if web). From that point, Spring manages the lifecycle of
  beans and the application flow.‚Äù
