Excellent question! Multithreading in Java evolved significantly starting with Java 8 and improved
even more after Java 8, especially in terms of asynchronous, functional, and scalable concurrency.

Here's a clear comparison to help you understand and answer this confidently in interviews.

‚úÖ Multithreading Changes in Java 8 and After
üîπ Java 8: Major Enhancements in Multithreading
Feature	Description	Example
Lambda Expressions	Concise thread creation with lambdas	new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Running")).start();
Functional Interfaces	Runnable, Callable used with lambdas	ExecutorService.submit(() -> "Task")
CompletableFuture	Advanced async programming with chaining	See example below
Stream Parallelism	Process collections in parallel	list.parallelStream().forEach(...)

‚úÖ Java 8 Example ‚Äì CompletableFuture
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> fetchData())
    .thenApply(data -> process(data))
    .thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Done: " + result));
Non-blocking
Chaining tasks
Exception handling with .exceptionally() or .handle()

üîπ After Java 8: Even More Powerful Features
Java Version	Feature	Description
Java 9	Flow API (Reactive Streams)	Back-pressure based Pub/Sub model
Java 19‚Äì21	Virtual Threads (Project Loom)	Lightweight threads for massive scalability
Java 21	Structured Concurrency (Preview)	Group multiple threads with single cancel/handle point

‚úÖ Java 21 Example ‚Äì Virtual Thread
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Handled by virtual thread: " + Thread.currentThread());
});
‚ö° Virtual threads are super-lightweight, so you can create thousands of concurrent tasks with low memory usage. Perfect for microservices!

‚úÖ Java 21 Example ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Preview)
try (var scope = StructuredTaskScope.shutdownOnFailure()) {
    Future<String> user  = scope.fork(() -> fetchUser());
    Future<String> order = scope.fork(() -> fetchOrder());

    scope.join();   // wait for both
    scope.throwIfFailed();

    return user.result() + order.result();
}
Useful for grouping and managing multiple threads as a unit.

üîÅ Summary: Evolution of Java Multithreading
Version	Key Feature	Benefits
Java 8	Lambdas, CompletableFuture, parallel streams	Simpler async code
Java 9	Flow API	Reactive programming
Java 11+	Improvements to executors, HTTP client	Better async REST
Java 19+	Virtual Threads	Massive scalability
Java 21	Structured concurrency	Easier concurrent task management

üß† Interview-Ready Answer:
‚ÄúJava 8 introduced major improvements in multithreading with CompletableFuture, lambdas, and parallel
 streams, making async programming cleaner and non-blocking. After Java 8, Java 21's virtual threads
 revolutionized concurrency by allowing thousands of lightweight threads, which is perfect for handling
 high-concurrency workloads like APIs in microservices. Structured concurrency also helps manage thread
 groups as one unit, improving reliability.‚Äù
