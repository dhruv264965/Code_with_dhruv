When a transaction occurs (like user payment, DB update, order placement), reducing the time taken means minimizing
 latency and bottlenecks across the stack.

Here are ways to reduce transaction time (with Java + Spring Boot perspective):

1. Database Optimization
âœ… Use proper indexing on frequently queried columns (e.g., userId, transactionId).
âœ… Use batch inserts/updates instead of multiple single queries.
âœ… Avoid N+1 queries (use JOIN fetch, projections, DTOs).
âœ… Optimize connection pooling (HikariCP) to avoid waiting for DB connections.

2. Reduce Synchronous Work

âœ… Use asynchronous processing (@Async, Kafka, RabbitMQ) for non-critical tasks (e.g., sending email/notifications
 after transaction).
âœ… Example: Complete DB commit first, then push notification event asynchronously.

3. Caching

âœ… Use Redis/Guava Cache for frequently accessed static data (e.g., exchange rates, product prices).
âœ… This reduces repeated DB calls inside a transaction.

4. Transaction Scope Management

âœ… Keep the transaction boundaries small (donâ€™t open a transaction for logging/notification).
âœ… Use read-only transactions (@Transactional(readOnly = true)) when no update is required.

5. Optimized APIs

âœ… Minimize payload size in request/response (avoid unnecessary fields).
âœ… Use gRPC or binary protocols if low latency is critical.
âœ… Enable connection pooling and HTTP/2 for faster API calls between services.

6. Parallel Execution

âœ… If transaction logic involves multiple independent operations (like fraud check + loyalty points + inventory update),
process them in parallel using CompletableFuture.

7. Profiling & Monitoring

âœ… Use APM tools (New Relic, AppDynamics, Spring Actuator + Micrometer) to identify bottlenecks.
âœ… Optimize the slowest component (DB, service call, serialization).

8. Infrastructure

âœ… Scale database with read replicas/sharding if load is high.
âœ… Use load balancing at API Gateway level.
âœ… Ensure enough thread pool & memory tuning in JVM.

ðŸ‘‰ Short Interview Answer Example (STAR):
"In one of my projects, transaction time was high due to synchronous email + notification handling. I reduced it by
moving those tasks to Kafka consumers. This cut the transaction time from ~2s to ~300ms. I also optimized DB queries
with proper indexing and smaller transaction boundaries. As a result, throughput improved significantly."
