The transient keyword in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be serialized —
meaning it will be ignored when converting an object into a byte stream (for saving to a file,
sending over a network, etc.).

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, but not all fields should
be serialized, such as:Passwords Sensitive user info
That’s where transient comes in — to skip such fields.
Syntax-
private transient String password;
