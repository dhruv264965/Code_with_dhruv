1. Syntax and Readability
.properties

Simple key-value pairs.
Best for straightforward configurations.
Can become hard to read when the configuration is hierarchical or large.
Example:
properties
Copy code
server.port=8080
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password
YAML (.yml)

Uses a structured format with indentation.
Easier to read and maintain for hierarchical or nested configurations.
Example:
yaml
Copy code
server:
  port: 8080
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
    username: root
    password: password


Choosing Between .properties and .yml
Use .properties if:

You prefer simplicity or have very basic configurations.
You're working in a legacy system that uses .properties.
Use YAML if:

You need to represent complex or hierarchical configurations.
You want better readability and maintainability for large configurations
