Quest-> What is API-
An API (Application Programming Interface) is essentially a set of rules and protocols that allow different software
applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request
and exchange information.

Quest-> Explain the process of caching in APIs. When would you use caching and what are its benefits?
Caching in APIs is the process of storing copies of responses so that subsequent requests for the same data can be served
more quickly without reprocessing the request or hitting the database. This improves performance, reduces latency,
and optimizes resource usage.
Types of API Caching
HTTP Caching (Headers-based): Using Cache-Control, ETag, Expires, etc.
In-Memory Caching: Storing data in memory using Redis, Memcached, etc.
Database Query Caching: Storing query results in cache.
CDN Caching: Using services like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront to cache API responses.
