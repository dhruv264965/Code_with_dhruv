The synchronized keyword in Java is a fundamental mechanism for ensuring thread safety in concurrent programming. However, it comes
with limitations that may make it unsuitable or less optimal for certain use cases. Below are the key limitations of synchronized:

1. No Timeout Capability
Limitation: Threads waiting to acquire a lock cannot specify a timeout. If a thread fails to acquire the lock, it will block indefinitely.
Implication: This can lead to potential deadlocks if the lock is never released.
2. No Interruptibility
Limitation: A thread blocked by synchronized cannot be interrupted.
Implication: This makes it challenging to implement responsive or cancelable tasks.
3. No Fairness
Limitation: The synchronized block does not guarantee any fairness or ordering in lock acquisition.
Implication: Threads may acquire locks in an arbitrary order, which could lead to starvation of certain threads.
4. Coarse-Grained Locking
Limitation: The synchronized keyword locks the entire method or block, which can be inefficient if only part of the code needs synchronization.
Implication: This can lead to performance bottlenecks, as threads are unnecessarily blocked even when they donâ€™t need to access the critical section.
5. Cannot Query Lock State
Limitation: The synchronized keyword does not provide methods to check the state of the lock (e.g., whether it is held or by which thread).
Implication: Debugging and monitoring thread states become difficult in complex scenarios.
6. No Read-Write Lock
Limitation: The synchronized keyword does not differentiate between read and write operations, requiring exclusive access for all operations.
Implication: This can be inefficient for scenarios where multiple threads can safely read shared data concurrently.
7. Limited Condition Handling
Limitation: The synchronized keyword only supports a single implicit condition associated with the intrinsic lock (using wait(), notify(), and notifyAll()).
Implication: It lacks the flexibility to manage multiple conditions or finer-grained thread communication.
8. Potential for Deadlocks
Limitation: Mismanagement of nested synchronized blocks or locks can lead to deadlocks, where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release locks.
Implication: Careful design is required to prevent such issues.
9. Performance Overhead
Limitation: The intrinsic lock used by synchronized can introduce significant overhead, especially in high-contention scenarios.
Implication: Other mechanisms like ReentrantLock or ReadWriteLock can be more efficient in certain use cases.
Alternatives to synchronized:
ReentrantLock: Offers explicit locking with advanced features like try-lock with timeout, interruptibility, and fairness policies.
ReadWriteLock: Provides separate locks for read and write operations, allowing multiple readers but only one writer.
Atomic Variables: For lock-free thread-safe operations on single variables (e.g., AtomicInteger).
Concurrent Collections: Classes like ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList provide thread-safe data structures without explicit locking.

In Synchronization only one thread can access a shared resource at a time .
