Daemon Thread:Thread runningin the background and used for logging and clanp operation
Daemon threads, on the other hand, are background threads that are used to provide services to user threads or to
perform tasks at the JVM level.

They do not prevent the JVM from exiting when all user threads have finished execution and only daemon threads are
left running.

Examples of daemon threads include garbage collector threads and threads created by certain libraries and frameworks.
Daemon threads are typically used for tasks that should not prevent the application from shutting down, such as
cleaning up resources or performing periodic maintenance tasks.

Use Cases for Daemon Threads:

Garbage Collection: The JVM uses daemon threads for garbage collection to reclaim memory used by objects that are no
 longer reachable.
Background Tasks: For tasks like monitoring, logging, or cleanup operations that are not critical to the main application
flow but need to be performed periodically.
Service Providers: Threads that provide services to other threads, such as managing connections or handling requests
in a server application.
