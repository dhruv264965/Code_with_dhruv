//In Java Threads, if any thread is in sleeping or waiting state (i.e. sleep() or wait() is invoked), calling the interrupt() method on
// the thread, breaks out the sleeping or waiting state throwing InterruptedException. If the thread is not in the sleeping or waiting
// state, calling the interrupt() method performs normal behavior and doesnâ€™t interrupt the thread but sets the interrupt flag to true.
//
//interrupt() method: If any thread is in sleeping or waiting for a state then using the interrupt() method, we can interrupt the
// execution of that thread by showing InterruptedException. A thread that is in the sleeping or waiting state can be interrupted with
// the help of the interrupt() method of Thread class.
