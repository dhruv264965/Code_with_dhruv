Spring Security is a powerful framework that provides comprehensive security services for Java applications.
 It is part of the Spring Framework and focuses on providing authentication, authorization, and other security
 features for Java applications, particularly those built using Spring. Here are some key aspects of
 Spring Security:

Authentication: Spring Security handles authentication by verifying the identity of users attempting to access
 an application. It supports various authentication mechanisms such as form-based login, HTTP Basic, OAuth,
 and more. You can integrate it with different authentication providers like LDAP, JDBC, in-memory, or custom
 implementations.

Authorization: Once authenticated, Spring Security manages authorization, determining what actions or resources
users are allowed to access based on their roles or permissions. This is typically managed through access
control rules configured using expressions or annotations.

Protection against common attacks: It provides protection against common web application security
vulnerabilities such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF), cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking,
 and others.

Integration with Spring ecosystem: Spring Security seamlessly integrates with other Spring projects like
Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Data, making it easier to incorporate security features into Spring-based
applications.

Customization and Extension: It allows extensive customization to fit various security requirements of
applications. Developers can create custom authentication providers, access decision voters, and security
filters to tailor security configurations.

Session Management: Spring Security manages user sessions, allowing configuration of session fixation
protection, session timeout, concurrent session control, and handling of session events.

CSRF Protection: It includes built-in CSRF protection, which is enabled by default for web applications to
prevent CSRF attacks.
