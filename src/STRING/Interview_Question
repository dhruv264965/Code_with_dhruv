String is the type of objects that can store the sequence of characters.
String is an immutable class which means a constant and cannot be changed once created and if wish to change
It is thread safe
There are two ways to create a string in Java:
String Literal-To make Java more memory efficient (because no new objects are created if it exists already in the
                string constant pool).
                string s="hello";
Using new Keyword-String s = new String(“Welcome”);
                  In such a case, JVM will create a new string object in normal (non-pool) heap memory and the literal
                   “Welcome” will be placed in the string constant pool. The variable s will refer to the object in
                   the heap (non-pool)

StringBuilder it creates a mutable sequence of characters
It is not thread safe
it is not synchronised
it is mainly used for single threaded program.
It is faster than both string and string buffer
memory store in heap
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
sb.append(" World");  // Modifies the original object
System.out.println(sb.toString()); // Prints: Hello World

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
StringBuffer it creates a mutable sequence of characters
It is thread safe
it is synchronised
it is mainly used for multi threaded program.
It is sloer than both stringBiulder but faster than string
memory store in heap
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
sb.append(" World");  // Modifies the original object
System.out.println(sb.toString()); // Prints: Hello World

        String s1 = "TAT";
        String s2 = "TAT";                   stack- s1,s2,s3,s4
                                             heap -  tat(for s1 and s2) tat(s3) tat(s4)
        String s3 = new String("TAT");
        String s4 = new String("TAT");
