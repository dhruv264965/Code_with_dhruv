Defination->A factory design pattern says that just define interface or abstract class for creating an object
            but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other word subclasses are responsible to
            create the instance of a class
-> Agar hamare pass parent class hai and bahut sare child class hai if we want child class object then we use factory design pattern
When to Use Factory Method Design Pattern?
Object Creation is Complex – When the process of creating objects is complicated, such as requiring multiple configurations or dependencies.
Decoupling Object Creation from Client Code – If you want to avoid exposing the instantiation logic and keep the client code independent of specific class implementations.
Enhancing Code Maintainability and Scalability – When new classes need to be added frequently without modifying existing client code.
Managing Object Creation Based on Input or Conditions – When the type of object created depends on some condition, such as user input, configuration, or runtime environment.
Improving Testability – By centralizing object creation, the Factory Pattern makes it easier to replace real objects with mocks or stubs for unit testing.
When You Have a Superclass with Multiple Subclasses – If a class has multiple subclasses, and the client code needs to work with their instances without knowing their concrete implementation.


Advantages of Factory Method Design Pattern-
✅ Encapsulation of Object Creation
Hides the complex instantiation logic from the client, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

✅ Loose Coupling
The client code depends only on the factory and the common interface, not on concrete implementations, reducing dependencies.
✅ Easier Maintenance and Scalability
New classes can be introduced without modifying existing client code.
✅ Improved Code Reusability
The same factory method can be reused to create different objects.
✅ Centralized Control Over Object Creation
Ensures consistent object creation logic and better management of instance creation.
✅ Encourages Open/Closed Principle (OCP) from SOLID Principles

New types can be added without modifying existing code, making the system extensible.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
factory design pattern - It encapsulate the object creation logic within separate class called factory.
                        When new classes need to be added frequently without modifying existing client code.

Example-Suppose we want to rent a vehicle (the vehicle can be anything like car , bike , bus etc. ) so instead
        of creating a vehicle we will go to a vehicle rental shop and it will give us our desired vehicle .
        This is what factory design does . In factory design pattern there is a method which is a factory
        which gives us desired object . It is one of the best ways to create an object where object creation
        logic is hidden from the client.

 Client-> Vehical factory(connect to vehical factory) -> Vehicle(interface , abstract class) -> car, bike , bus -> Product class

 Benefit- Loose coupling- The client code depends only on the factory and the common interface, not on concrete implementations, reducing dependencies.
          Hide complex logic from client
