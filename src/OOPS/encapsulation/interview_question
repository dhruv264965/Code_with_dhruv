Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.
It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.
combines data and methods in a class.
advantages of Encapsulation
Data Hiding: Encapsulation provides data hiding. Users donâ€™t see the implementation of the class.
The user only knows that we are passing the values to a setter method and variables are getting initialized with
that value.

ðŸ”¹ Definition: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class) while restricting direct access to the data from outside the class.

ðŸ”¹ Key Idea:

Protects data by making it private and exposing only what is necessary through public methods (getters/setters).
Prevents accidental modification of important data.
