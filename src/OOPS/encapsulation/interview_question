Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.
It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.
combines data and methods in a class.
advantages of Encapsulation
Data Hiding: Encapsulation provides data hiding. Users donâ€™t see the implementation of the class.
The user only knows that we are passing the values to a setter method and variables are getting initialized with
that value.

ðŸ”¹ Definition: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into
a single unit (class) while restricting direct access to the data from outside the class.

ðŸ”¹ Key Idea:

Protects data by making it private and exposing only what is necessary through public methods (getters/setters).
Prevents accidental modification of important data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (variables) and methods (functions that operate on the data)
together as a single unit, known as a class. It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and
only exposes the necessary parts through methods.
important point-1.Encapsulation is about data protection â€” we keep variables private and expose access through methods.
               2. encapsulation hides data,only exposes the necessary parts through methods.
                3.Prevents accidental modification of important data.
                4. Restricting direct access to the data from outside the class.
