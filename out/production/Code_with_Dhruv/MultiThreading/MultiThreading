*Multithreading -->is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.
Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.

Thread Class vs Runnable Interface -->
*If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class because Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance. But,
if we implement the Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base classes.
*We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class because it provides some inbuilt methods like yield(),
interrupt() etc. that are not available in Runnable interface.
*Using runnable will give you an object that can be shared amongst multiple threads.
*            Thread                                  |            Runnable
->Thread is a class. It is used to create a thread   |->Runnable is a functional interface which is used to create a thread (task/work)
-> It has multiple methods including start() and     |->It has only abstract method run()
    run().                                           |
->Each thread creates a unique object and gets       |-> Multiple threads share the same objects
  associated with it.                                |
-> More memory required                              |->Less memory required
->Multiple Inheritance is not allowed in java        |->  If a class is implementing the runnable
  hence after a class extends Thread class, it       |     interface then your class can extend another
  can not extend any other class                     |    class

Difference between Thread.start() and Thread.run() in Java-->
*New Thread creation: When a program calls the start() method, a new thread is created and then the run() method is executed. But
                      if we directly call the run() method then no new thread will be created and run() method will be executed as
                      a normal method call on the current calling thread itself and no multi-threading will take place.
*start()-Can’t be invoked more than one time otherwise throws java.lang.IllegalStateException.
 run()-Multiple invocation is possible
*start()-Defined in java.lang.Thread class.
 run()-Defined in java.lang.Runnable interface and must be overridden in the implementing class.

Excuator Framework- (Thread Pools)->
A framework having a bunch of components that are used for managing worker threads efficiently is referred to as Executor Framework.
The Executor API reduces the execution of the task from the actual task to be executed through the Executors.
we have to create a thread pool for executing the task by submitting that task to that thread pool.
* shutdown() - when shutdown() method is called on an executor service, it stops accepting new tasks, waits for previously
               submitted tasks to execute, and then terminates the executor
* shutdownNow() - this method interrupts the running task and shuts down the executor immediately.
*The java.util.concurrent.Executors provide factory methods that are being used to create ThreadPools of worker threads.
   Thread pools overcome this issue by keeping the threads alive and reusing the threads. Any excess tasks flowing in, that the
   threads in the pool can’t handle are held in a Queue. Once any of the threads get free, they pick up the next task from this queue.
   This task queue is essentially unbounded for the out-of-box executors provided by the JDK.
Some types of Java Executors are listed below:
1-SingleThreadExecutor-A thread pool of single thread can be obtained by calling the static newSingleThreadExecutor() method of the
                       Executors class. It is used to execute tasks sequentially.
                       ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
2-FixedThreadPool(n)-As the name indicates, it is a thread pool of a fixed number of threads. The tasks submitted to the executor
                 are executed by the n threads and if there is more task they are stored on a LinkedBlockingQueue. It uses Blocking Queue.
                 ExecutorService fixedPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
3-CachedThreadPool-Creates a thread pool that creates new threads as needed, but will reuse previously constructed threads when
              they are available. Calls to execute will reuse previously constructed threads if available. If no existing thread is available, a
               new thread will be created and added to the pool. It uses a SynchronousQueue queue.
               ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
4-ScheduledExecutor-Scheduled executors are based on the interface ScheduledExecutorService which extends the ExecutorService
        interface. This executor is used when we have a task that needs to be run at regular intervals or if we wish to delay a certain task.
        ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecService = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
